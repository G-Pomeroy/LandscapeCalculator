# C++ Landscape Calculator

This is an iteration of the same landscape calculator that was previously created in Java, now done in C++. This was also an assignment for the IT Programming course with the NSCC.

## Overview

The premise of this console application is the same as the previous version where the calculator will accept the dimensions of the yard, type of grass, number fo trees, and then calculate the total cost of the landscaping job.
